The mprotect() function is used to change the access protection of the memory mappings for the process within the range of address
specified as parameter1 and parameter2.
We are using the arguments PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE|PROT_EXEC. This allows the process
to read, write and execute the memory mapped within the specified range.
We specify the address range that we are leveraging the options on which is
starting address of the buffer to the length of shellcode + 10.
Since we are changing access protection to allow execution of the memory address, our code to open a shell gets executed
just like an HTML tag being rendered by a web browser in a cross site script attack.

However, as we comment the method call we no longer provide execution privilege to the memory pages and hence the program does not execute resulting in a segmentation fault.
